# Intelligent-Agent-Treasure-Maze

•	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project:
What code were you given?

I received a TreasureEnvironment.py file, which includes the entire environment code, including a maze object defined as a matrix. Additionally, I received a GameExperience.py file that contains the complete code for experience replay. I also received a full implementation to construct a neural network model and a Play Game function to determine the pirate's ability to win any game.

What code did you create yourself?

I created a Q-Training Algorithm that finds the best possible navigation sequence that results in reaching the treasure cell while maximizing the reward. In my implementation, I was able to achieve a 99% win rate.


•	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists work on developing and improving technologies that are driven by computing. They solve complex problems, design innovative systems, and explore new possibilities enabled by computing technologies. Computer science matters because it supports much of the modern world, from the software that runs on our devices to the algorithms that power internet search engines and social media platforms.

•	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When approaching a problem as a computer scientist I gain a clear understanding of the problem I am trying to solve. Next, I break the problem down into smaller, more manageable parts and choose an appropriate strategy or algorithm to solve each part of the problem. I then implement my strategy and evaluate the effectiveness of my solution.


•	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, I am ethically responsible for safeguarding user data privacy through the implementation of secure data-handling practices and adherence to relevant regulations. I must also ensure the security of systems and data by employing robust security measures, such as encryption, access controls, and regular security audits. Additionally, I am responsible for designing and implementing algorithms and systems in a fair and unbiased manner, considering factors like race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Lastly, I must be transparent about the use of algorithms and data, providing clear explanations of their impact on users.
